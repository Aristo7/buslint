If this doesn't excite you, then you must be a god among programmers. Everyone knows that in Lumberyard, all runtime problems come down to forgetting to connect to a bus!

The goal is to catch more common problems, but for now the main check this does is to see if you are handling any busses, and forgot to connect to them in your source.

## Installation

I'm not sure this is the best way to use WAF, so let me know if you know of a better way. However, it's not hard.
